====================

## Naive Bayes Spam Filter
This .py function takes in a training directory containing spam emails, a training directory containing non-spam (ham) emails,
and a directory to test the filter on. It creates a spam probability dictionary and uses a Naive Bayes algorithm to sort emails 
in the testing directory into either sorted_spam or sorted_ham. 

To test my code I used 2 files that can be downloaded at http://spamassassin.apache.org/publiccorpus/
For the training ham directory, I used 20030228_easy_ham.tar.bz2, and for the training spam directory and for the test directory I used 
20030228_spam.tar.bz2.
